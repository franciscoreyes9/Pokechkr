# Pokéchkr

Pokéchkr is a web-based tool designed for Pokémon Emerald enthusiasts! 
This project allows users to build their own Pokémon squad and check all 
the gym leaders in the game. It is a personal project developed to learn about **single-page applications (SPAs)** using **React**.

- **Gym Leaders Overview**: Get information on all 8 gym leaders, including their location, badge, and the Pokémon they use.
- **Responsive Layout**: Works seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the SPA and handling state management efficiently.
- **HTML**: For structuring the components of the application.
- **CSS**: To style and make the application visually appealing.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For the logic behind interactivity, such as adding Pokémon to your team and displaying gym leader information.
